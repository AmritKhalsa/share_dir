Made an file to compute summation(n^k), change the value of variable 'sum' to get summation(n^sum), so if sum = 1, you get 
sum(n^1) and output = n(n+1)/2, but like this 1/2n^2 + 1/2n, etc ..

Initially this algorithm was used in a side project in my game engine in OpenGl, but then I found out of the power summation by
Jacob Bernoulli and I just thought my method was extremely clever so I'm publishing it on github.
